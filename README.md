# Map-Marker
This app is used to collect interesting places I found in my life.

This is my first Swift app project, and the app should collect the perfect places I have met during the urban exploration.

Now, the app has a mapviewer with annonations, I will add the core functions ASAP.

TO DO LIST:
1. Make the app r/w the annonation data files to the user local space.
2. Add a ADD button for users to mark their places.
